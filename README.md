# TruckerApp

## A fully functional Employee’s management system for assigning missions

this project was built specially for my father who came to me and asked for a simple way to assign mission for his truck drivers.

In this project I learned how to use JWT and also store it inside cookies in order to retrive the user info on the backend, and i learned on how to use a new state management system called zustand.

it was built with:
* React for the front end side of things in order to organize the code with simple and scalable components.
* Zustand for state management of the app.
* Scss in order to style the project with the ease of BEM methodology
* Node.js, Express & MongoDB in order to create an api and apply simple CRUD operations
